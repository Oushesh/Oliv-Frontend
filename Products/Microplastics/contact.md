### Microplastics Analysis: Commercial Laboratory Comparison (2026)

| Lab Name | Location | Estimated Price (per sample) | Methodology | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wasser 3.0** | Karlsruhe / Global | €350 - €500 | Fluorescence Markers | High speed; excellent for rapid screening. |
| **MIQALab GmbH** | Germany | €400 - €800+ | Raman / FT-IR | The "TUM Gold Standard"; best for complex matrices like coffee. |
| **SGS Institut Fresenius** | Taunusstein / Munich | €600 - €1,200 | Full Regulatory Grade | Highest industry recognition; ideal for formal certifications. |
| **WESSLING** | Munich / Neu-Ulm | Request Quote | Pyrolysis GC/MS or FT-IR | Versatile; Pyrolysis is best for determining total plastic mass. |

**Technical Specifications:**
* **Detection Limits:** Raman methods typically detect down to **1 µm**, while FT-IR is reliable down to **10–20 µm**.
* **Preparation:** Complex samples (like espresso) require an organic digestion phase, which is generally included in the premium pricing tiers.
* **Turnaround Time:** Ranges from 10 business days (Screening) to 4 weeks (Full Chemical Imaging).
